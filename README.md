# TinyMCE Javascript Accordion

Plugin to replace CKEditor accordion, work in progress.

## Installation

- Install this module using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules)
- Edit your custom TinyMCE profile to add this toolbar button

Functionality sort of overlaps with CKEditor accordion plugin, but should not
conflict.
