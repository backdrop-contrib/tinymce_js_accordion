# TinyMCE Javascript Accordion

TinyMCE plugin that replicates the functionality of the [CKEditor Accordion](https://backdropcms.org/project/ckeditor_accordion)
plugin for this alternative editor. To make switching easier.

It's possible to toggle on the fly between the two plugins without any
changes to content, as this plugin re-uses the same CSS class
(ckeditor-accordion).

It's also possible to have both modules on in parallel, as they don't
conflict.

## Installation

- Install this module using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules)
- Edit your custom TinyMCE profile on admin/config/content/tinymce-builder to
  add this plugin's toolbar button
